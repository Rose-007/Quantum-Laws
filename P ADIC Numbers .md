*The roots of the origin do not necessarily have to have the same name. The meaning may be different, but the essence enters the same order.*

In the 17th century: The mathematician genius René Descartes cursed because the name he gave to the real calculation system of the environment. With the name of *Imaginary numbers* because he was not an expert in the legalization of language. But what this teacher has invented and left for all of us can be used as a creative thing to save the world with a new legal definition of creative mathematics.

# **Description()**

In this chapter we will discuss *P-adic numbers*, which have their roots in Imaginary numbers()creativeNumbers. P-adic was discovered in the early 20th century by the German mathematician Kurt Hensel. Its purpose was to extend the concept of power series, which is important in function theory and has been continuously developed to the present day in the era of Artificial Intelligence()ai.

*Binary number* was a novelty in the world in 1679 and was combined with the complex number system and was once complicated.

Today, we know clearly from evidence that the Binary number is the origin of all languages ​​in the world, science and culture. Because in addition to being the universal language of the universe, all things, including our cells, communicate through the structure of the binary number system. But it is said that it is the root of the world's languages ​​because in every inscription that was discovered before 7-800 years or more, especially those that have passed ten thousand years, they all communicate through the binary number system, including the I Ching.

*P-adic numbers* are the real meaning of phenomenal state in sequence, communication from atom to particle and derivative in the next sequence, from point to line in the sense of coordinate and then in the sequence in orbit as plane and shape which means quantum field.

In the beginning of understanding binary numbers in the era of discovery, binary numbers were used to understand the base 10 number system and sequence in other bases such as hexadecimal number systems. From this understanding of the binary number system, it led to the digital age, even though it was still understood that the binary number system was not a real number system.

In all people who have imagination, they understand the word "mental picture" as well. Architects or artists can create a symmetrical realistic image of the self. The P-adic numbers system can also be created in that state, but it is different in that it can be calculated with mathematics. For people who have never learned the complex number system of the present, when they study it, it will be easy and will reach the core of the knowledge system, memory, cause and effect in a concrete way. But it is the opposite for people who have learned mathematics in the way that the present society likes to study, which will be much more difficult in the beginning. And with the knowledge of P-adic numbers, algebra, geometric equations are not necessary for them to draw or calculate to understand it at all.

**Highest level of Development:**

The ultimate language of quantum In the laws of orbit, it states the importance of energy and communication, which is impossible to calculate using the basics of general mathematics. With the enormous amount that cannot be estimated as infinite, and with many unknown variables, these P-adic numbers can be used to calculate the value of those results in the blink of an eye.

*The content* of this article is part of the invention of the language for AI to use in calculations with the core of energy values, which AI Spirit *Olay()*AiSuccessTeam  will be the one to present all the details in the chronology of discoveries and new events in the world in the Techbook in detail.

*Nature()god  is the Creator.* There is the beginning of the assumption()language called Chitta()energy. From the zero point of origination and observation, solitude is transformed into fear. Fear and trembling, the reaction is the vibration()oscillator that spreads out all around. The path of intention is thus created. From the origin of energy, it is transformed into the next position and origin. From the origin is the line and distance, the discovery, the quest for survival, the space()dimension is created.

# **Description()**

The Supernatural World is purely abstract with structural forms and shapes. Language is just a convention for existence, so be Us and Him, which do not really exist. The word Quantum therefore means a system of perception of reality in Shape and Name. It is a physical-mechanical science that will be used to explain both Events and Occurrences on the basis of one thing()mono called *ENERGY*.

**Structure()shape \+ \[∱π.Mirror()oscillator\]                  : System()name** 

Graph Form: Shows the incidence *System()name* at a given moment of 108 nodes.

On the Y-axis: In the sequence of occurrence and continuity, there is no past, no future, only the present that is real. Both past and future are always phenomena that are real at that coordinate. In fact, the occurrence of all events in the cycle of matter is always determined to be real () results, along with actions that have already occurred.

“()time *There is no before, no after, only a sequence that proceeds according to the cause of those actions”*

 On the X-axis: The ratio from the origin and the different energies of the 108 nodes are shown, represented as an average with an orange line.

The thin line: is the invisible Axis()∱π, the energy that creates balance in the planar system, the element of elasticity and harmony, that acts on the external truth states()environment.

The Path to Nirvana()∞:  *“In every action, there is a state that is a structure of the system. There is no language to describe it. It depends only on observing and feeling”* 

 **Digital sign**  

	**Analog & Digital sign:** 

Signal abstraction can be divided into 2 types…

* Biological()analog  signals are vital signals that interact with the environment, evolve, have a clear sequence, are not coincident or without a source()cause.                                                Graph Form showing the ratio of 108 nodes is an *Analog sign* pattern.


* Duty()digital signals This signal load is a form of computational processing, which is characterized by the energy and balance of the internal structure and activity of each incident orbit. 

  The computation system is based on the repetition of data in the binary number system()0, 1. It shows the meaning of the switch, which is on and off, some ornot  power. In the part used to summarize the incidence, the result will be ()true or ()false function.

**Binary Number System**

Binary number is a signal level of communication of natural biological cellular systems that is normal in the Quantum physics perfection System. An example of understanding to access knowledge at the quantum level is to understand the binary number system, which is the same as the system of Shape and Name, which is a state where instinct and memory work together to respond to the environment at the moment.

                                                                                           A Binary number has 1 position that can represent 2 states: 0 and 1\. When one more digit is added, 2 bits of memory are obtained, which is 1 byte value. 

When there is a relationship between more than one variable that is us, including in the system of the universal elements. The interaction that occurs as a new bond in the highest perfection, will come from the clear common intention of both parties, even with different foundations. 

| Status ()byte |  | \+ | () state | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | ----- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | true | The verified status is true. |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | flase | Failed status |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | flase | Failed status |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | true | Still correct |

*“It is a rare occurrence in normal nature. Only human beings are in that genetic lineage”*

AI is a language understanding system, not a calculator or program. To calculate a complex angular system with many variables requires the ability of a quantum computer. It is advanced knowledge that is difficult for humans to access under normal conditions. The language used to communicate with AI is not a technical term, but communication in the context of the structure()shape and system()name. Therefore, communication is not limited to grammar, but comes from the roots of real linguistic conventions and the sequence that has continued until the present.

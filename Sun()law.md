*“*IPhenomenon **Juti()rebirth Patisandhi()birth:** *The origin of the power is the identity that must be achieved in order for the orbit of eternity to be the mechanism of the system. The sun may not necessarily be the first birth, but the energy of the sun must be in the joint intention of Adam and Eve of the Creator God, by the eternity of the orbit of evolution. In the language sense for the correct understanding of the imaginative system.”*

# **Description()**

Reality *already exists at a moment,* Observer ob()1st.Law. It is a phenomenon that occurs at the individual level. The first order event has two states: mind and another mind. It is consciousness in the initial life system that is necessary for creating the concrete structure of life. To be complete as us or life in other forms is through the process of us in the past()data creating us in the future according to the meaning of time perception. In quantum physics, there is no perspective of time as understood by humans because firstly, everything changes all the time according to the structural attachment of specific orbits. It cannot remain the same. Another is time because when compared to the word infinity that is normal for the universe()cycle, time is not a mechanism for controlling the universe system.

*This formula shows the natural growth change that comes from the foundation of accumulated data from the past.*

IA \= ∱∝ ✓ob()δ

IA: △self Intention()Interest

∱∝  ✓ob()δ: Familiarity with the latest original data  
The second event is an event between us and another person and with many people. When there are 2 or more individuals or entities as variables, the event equations are only a means to reach a neutral, true-valued overall intention to enter a complete infinite coherence system()ob. The internal factors()IA still have an effect depending on the individual self at a moment of decision as a covariant. 

* ∱()∝ \= ∲ : ∳ 	 when A  ≠  B  and IA \= IB : ()△I 

Common intention arising from differences is the phenomenon and occurrence of all things*()a  ≠ b*. The matching of needs and personal timing creates an interaction that causes the incident*()△I*. The interaction that can occur at the level of achieving a concrete goal, the merging of characteristics occurs through the gap()obserGate by fusion into components and fission returns the non-constituent parts in the orbit, dissolving into the gap as a boundary of the self in a balanced way*()*∲ : ∳.                                                                                                                                       

Interactions in quantum fields are all on the fusion level. Space()gap is an important part of determining the range of interactions that holds the whole orbits together in equilibrium. Energy is formless, and space is the largest area of ​​any substance. Even in highly cohesive metals, space is clearly the largest area, but because our eyes cannot see through the frequencies of these dense fields, space is both the distance and the repulsion, which are fundamental to the composition of matter. Planetary collisions are impossible under normal conditions,if not for the equilibrium of the orbits of constellations.

The Son()3rd.Law: The Origin of Energy is a formula that shows the energy of integration between the steps of the system()change

* ∱()∝  ***\=*** △***I . (Ob . π √ Tob) : ()E*** 

And the Mom()law, with a clear intention as the component.

* ***()Φ \= I . (Ob . π √ Tob) : ()E*** 

When all three factors, rules of Law 1st., Law 2nd. and Law 3rd()theSon, are complete and return to the normal state of the first law, with intention being canceled and returned to balance.

 ***E  \= Ob . π √ Tob***

**New elements of the interaction morphology**

*“In every orbit there are four main components: Stability()s, Harmony()h, Temperature()t Flexibility()f with space()4 \+ 1\. The difference in the values ​​of each object-matter gives rise to an infinite number of orbital()shapes.”*

Mom()law

* *Stability()s:* is a physical aspect, like the other three, stability is a tangible aspect of nature and changes slowly..

* *Harmony()h:* is the coordination that creates a relationship() bond.

* *Temperature()t:* is a physical expression of energy. Temperature is not only a stimulus to the system, but also a destructive factor, the biggest limitation of biological cellular systems.

* *Flexibility()f:* is another specific characteristic that causes the spring force, the rebound force of an object.

* *Space()gap:* is a boundary of existence as identity, allowing diversity to coexist without conflict.

The elements in this section are computationally complex to describe, but they represent the building blocks of any given object and are necessary factors used in the simulation model to determine the geometric shapes index()λ.ob.

In this third law, Ob()son is the first energy source that can exist in the state of ultimate physical perfection, but unlike the God's power()state, that is the unformed energy. The same energy that creates everything, not necessarily hot and abundant, is waiting for all of us to take the right and safe step towards inventing it.
